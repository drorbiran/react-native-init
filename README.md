Clone this repository to start a project based on

```
"react-native": "0.51.1",
"react": "^16.3.0-alpha.1",
"react-native-navigation": "^2.0.0",
"react-native-ui-lib": "^3.3.32"
```


Check `react-native-navigation`'s [documentation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/v2/#/) for usage details.


### preparing your project

Download npm dependencies:

```sh
npm i -g react-native-cli
npm install
```

### Renaming the project
If you would like to rename the project you can use [React Native Rename](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-rename)

After running React Native Rename, in order to run the project successfully, you will need to manually update your app name in `src/screens.js`, where `<appname>` is the name of your app.

```diff
-  Navigation.registerComponent('reactNativeInit.App', () => App);
+  Navigation.registerComponent('<appname>.App', () => App);
```

### Running your project

From project dir, run:

#### iOS
1. Run the packager

	```
	npm run start
	```
	

2. Open the project in xcode from `ios/reactNativeInit.xcodeproj`
3. Build and run from Xcode

#### Android
1. Start an emulator
2. Build and run

	```sh
	react-native run-android
	```
	This would also start a packager if not already started


3. Set your Emulator to live reload changes `âŒ˜`+`m`  (`cmd`+`m`) => `Enable Hot Reloading`

To open packager manually, from project dir run:

```sh
react-native start
```
